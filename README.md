## Description

I built this project to showcase my skills and experience as a software engineer visually, technically and practically. This project
enables individuals and organizations interested in my work to get a quick overview of my experience and skill.

I learnt how to use PostCSS, how to implement the typewriter effect & how to create a variety of visual effects such as changing color gradients
and blurring elements using CSS.
