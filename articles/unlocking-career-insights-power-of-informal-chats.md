# Unlocking Career Insights: The Power of Informal Chats

In the bustling world of technology, navigating your career path can feel like a maze. One shortcut to clarity is the informal chat, a casual yet insightful conversation with someone whose career path you admire.

Imagine having a candid conversation with a seasoned professional from a company you would like to work at. Learning about their daily routine, the challenges they faced, and the strategies that helped them succeed.

This is possible for many ambitious programmers through informal chats.

### **My Chat with Dustin Mitchell**

Recently, I had the privilege of engaging in an informal chat with Dustin Mitchell, a former Mozilla employee, where I was an intern through the Outreachy program. Dustin is now a part of the Google team. Dustin's experience and insights were invaluable, offering a unique perspective on the tech industry.

### **How to Conduct an Informal Chat**

* **Boldness and Outreach:** Don't shy away from reaching out to those whose careers you admire. The key is to be genuine and open about why you're reaching out.

* **Clarity and Brevity:** Keep your message concise and to the point. Clearly state the purpose of your chat, your professional background, the duration you're aiming for (15 - 30 minutes recommended), and the formats they can choose from (video call or text-based).

* **Preparedness:** List your questions in advance, ensuring you're ready to dive into the conversation, in case you get an immediate response to your request for an informal chat.


### **Key Takeaways from My Chat with Dustin**

* **Workday Structure:** Dustin's day at Google is a mix of mentoring, design documentation, meetings, and focus-time work blocks. Dustin emphasized the importance of time management and leveraging the collective knowledge within organizations.

* **Work Planning:** Determine the estimated time and mental capacity required for tasks. Allocate simpler tasks appropriately between meetings, and allocate complex tasks in the focus-time work blocks on your calendar.

* **Open Source vs. Closed Source:** The major difference between working in open source as compared to closed source environments is more in-depth code reviews from colleagues and contributors. However, adaptability and interpersonal skills are the most important tools for navigating various perspectives in both environments.

* **Career Advancement Strategy:** Networking at your level and one step above, as these individuals are often closer to the roles you aspire to. For example, a Junior Engineer with 2 years of experience is more likely to know when an Entry-level role is open as compared to a Senior or Staff engineer.

* **Taking Control of Your Career Path:** To ensure your career progression aligns with your interests, focus on the people you work with. Collaboration and compatibility are key. Additionally, developing a broad skill set can make you more attractive to future employers. Don’t be disheartened if you don’t end up working in exactly the job you desire, as long as the work environment supports career growth.


In summary, informal chats offer a unique opportunity to learn from successful professionals in the tech industry. To conduct an effective informal chat, be bold, clear, and prepared.

My key takeaways from my informal chat included insights into daily work routines, career strategies, and the importance of networking. Lastly, focusing on your work environment and the people you work with rather than having your desired job role can significantly impact your career progression.

Keep in mind that I received these takeaways in response to the questions I asked. Don’t be afraid, most people will not respond to a request for an informal chat. However, those who respond will be helpful, and you will gain knowledge you didn't have before. Remember to always be professional and friendly in these requests and chats.
