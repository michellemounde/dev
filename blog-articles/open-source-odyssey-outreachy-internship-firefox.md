# Open Source Odyssey: My Outreachy Internship with Firefox

Diving into the world of open source, as a beginner, can be a highly rewarding challenge. And that's exactly what I did when I embarked on my Outreachy Internship with Firefox. I was tasked with implementing a rewind feature for the Firefox Update Server.

This journey was filled with challenges, surprises, and ultimately, growth. In this post, I'll share my insights, lessons learned, and how this experience has shaped my perspective on open source contributions and how they can help to further your professional development in the tech industry.

### **From Fear to Confidence**

Before starting, I was apprehensive. The thought of making significant contributions to a project like the [rewind rules feature](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3079) and [rewind diff mode](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3085) was daunting. However, to my surprise, I not only completed these tasks but also took on additional responsibilities, including [refactoring the API](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3092) and implementing [permission-based sign-offs](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3088).

My internship was not just about overcoming technical hurdles, but also about building confidence in my abilities to contribute to open source projects and collaborate with a team of experienced developers.

### **Lessons Learned**

My internship was a course in communication skills, technical proficiency, and the joy of contributing to meaningful projects. I learned to articulate my work in a way that team members could understand, enhancing my ability to present complex ideas simply. Additionally, I gained exposure to advanced React applications, Flask applications, regex, Material UI. I also learned how to ask better clarifying questions and how to navigate unfamiliar codebases. This journey wasn't just about coding, it was about growing as a developer and as a team member.

### **Project Highlights**

Under the guidance of my mentors, Gabriel Bustamante and Ben Hearsum, and the support of Johan Lorenzo, the Release Engineering Manager, I successfully completed the [rewind rules feature](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3079), [rewind diff mode](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3085) and [API refactoring](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3092). My changes to [permission-based sign-offs](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/pull/3088) are still under review and being finalized. My contributions have improved the Firefox Update Server, and I am proud to have been a part of this journey.

> As I reflect on my Outreachy Internship,

I am reminded of the doubts I had about getting into the internship, the importance of starting early and the power of pushing even when you are stuck by trying different approaches to problem-solving. If you're a beginner or even if you're unsure about your abilities, I encourage you to apply for internships like Outreachy.
